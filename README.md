# Traffic-Forecasting-Time-Series

**Project: Traffic Forecasting - Time Series Analysis**

**Objective:**
Unicorn Ventures is exploring an investment opportunity in JetRail, a revolutionary transportation system using Jet propulsion technology. The decision to invest heavily relies on the projection that JetRail can attract over 1 Million monthly users within the next 18 months. In collaboration with Unicorn Ventures, this project aims to forecast the traffic on JetRail for the upcoming 7 months, providing crucial insights for the investment decision.

**Dataset Information:**
The dataset comprises three key features - ID, Datetime, and Count. Leveraging time series analysis, we delve into forecasting the user traffic, a pivotal factor in evaluating JetRail's potential market penetration.

**Project Workflow:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Conducted thorough data preprocessing to ensure data integrity and cleanliness. This involved handling missing values, formatting datetime data, and structuring the dataset for analysis.

2. **Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Employed visualizations to gain insights into traffic patterns, identifying trends, seasonality, and potential anomalies. EDA played a vital role in understanding the underlying structure of the data.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Utilized robust preprocessing techniques, including RobustScaler() for numerical features and OneHotEncoding for categorical variables, to enhance the model's robustness and accuracy.

4. **Machine Learning Model Selection:** Employed a combination of classical time series forecasting models and machine learning techniques. The chosen models include Linear Regression, FBprophet, and ARIMA, each offering unique insights into the traffic forecasting task.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Rigorously tested and evaluated the models using a dedicated test dataset to ensure their performance on unseen data. The models demonstrated robust predictive capabilities, showcasing their viability for forecasting JetRail traffic.

**Outcome:**
The ensemble of models successfully generated accurate traffic forecasts for the upcoming days, providing Unicorn Ventures with valuable insights. The project not only aids in making an informed investment decision but also establishes a foundation for ongoing monitoring and refinement of the traffic forecasting model.

By leveraging data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and a diverse set of forecasting models, this project aligns with Unicorn Ventures' commitment to data-driven decision-making. The results obtained demonstrate the project's success in contributing crucial insights for the investment evaluation process.

**Next Steps:**
The forecasting models developed in this project can serve as a dynamic tool for ongoing traffic predictions. Continuous monitoring and refinement will be essential to adapt to changing patterns and ensure the reliability of the forecasts, supporting Unicorn Ventures in making strategic investment decisions.

This project underlines the potential of JetRail and positions Unicorn Ventures to make well-informed decisions in line with their investment strategy.
